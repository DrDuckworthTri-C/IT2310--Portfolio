    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
    
    <p>This week, I am building the foundation for everything I do this semester. I set up my development environment, created my first HTML page, established my GitHub portfolio repository, and began learning prompt engineering skills that will help me work effectively with AI tools throughout the course.</p>
    
    <p>I'm excited to learn <strong>how to create a website</strong> this semester.</p>
