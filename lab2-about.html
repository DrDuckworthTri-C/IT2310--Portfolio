    <h1>About Lab 2</h1>
    <p>In this lab, I learned how to create links that connect pages within my website using relative paths and links that open external websites using absolute paths. I discovered that adding target="_blank" to external links opens them in a new tab, which keeps visitors on my site while still giving them access to outside resources. I also learned how to build HTML tables with accessibility in mind by using <caption> to describe the table's purpose, <thead> and <tbody> to organize content, and <th scope="col"> to identify header cells for screen readers. These accessibility features ensure that all users, including those using assistive technologies, can understand and navigate my content. Finally, I practiced using mailto: links to let visitors contact me directly through email.</p>

                <th scope="col">Description</th>
            </tr>

                <td><a href="lab2-home.html">Home Page</a></td>
